# Lagrange-Polynomial-Interpolation-Tool
Lagrange Polynomial Interpolation Tool is a C++ program designed to perform polynomial interpolation using LPI method. Given a set of known data points  ( 𝑥𝑖, 𝑦𝑖 ), the program calculates the estimated value of a function at any desired point  𝑥 = 𝑥𝑖  , where the actual function is unknown or difficult to compute directly.
